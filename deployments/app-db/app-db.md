### What is this

Some sample manifests i found on the internet.

These manifests create:

- A deployment called 'hello-world' in the namespace 'training'
- Service (also called hello-world

Configurations deploy a blank ruby-on-rails hello world application with port 3000 exposed and a load balancer for this service.
