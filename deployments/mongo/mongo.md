### What is this

These are configuration files for a sample JS web app with MongoDB from a k8s [crash course](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/k8s-in-1-hour).

I deployed this app not using minikube (as course suggested) but using a regular k8s cluster on VirtualBox.

This project uses some basic kubernetes components like:
- ConfigMap
- Secret
- Deployment
- Service
- NodePort

This course was very fun to follow & i feel i learned something in this one ;)
