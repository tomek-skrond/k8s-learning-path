# k8s-learning-path

This repository is my space for documenting:

- what i have learned,

- what i want to learn,

- what i want to accomplish

during my development on kubernetes related topics

Enjoy ;)

If you want to try out kubernetes (and not get stomped by installation), check out my repo [kube-provisioning-scripts](https://github.com/tomek-skrond/kube-provisioning-scripts) (for now available only for Linux users).
